Hey 👋, Thanks for stopping by! 

I spend my day-to-day working as a Mobile Team lead and Senior Android Engineer. I started playing with Android since 2011 with the [Froyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Froyo){:target="_blank"} (🧁) version at that time 💚. I had the opportunity to work on multiple mobile and web applications using different platform and technology while being focused on Android applications for the past several years. It’s something that I’m very proud of and passionate about.

I’m currently a Mobile team lead and Senior Android Engineer at [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/){:target="_blank"}. At Trainline 🚅, I help create the future of the travelers community by encouraging people to make more environmentally sustainable travel choices by providing them a product where they can search, book and manage their journeys all in one place.

Previously, I was working at [Nespresso](https://www.nespresso.com/){:target="_blank"} ☕️ as a Senior Android Engineer and then as a Mobile Solution Architect, providing technical and functional customer oriented solutions for the E-commerce and M-commerce platforms. It was a great experience and I truly enjoyed my time there.

During the same time, I spent 5 years working at [SQLI](https://www.sqli.com/){:target="_blank"}. I participated in collaboration with large mobile/web teams to create new applications/features or improve existing projects.

I’m currently in Paris, France 🇫🇷.
